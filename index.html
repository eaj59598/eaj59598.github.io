		<div>I figured the sheer fact that I was your top Computer Science student ever would be enough information about myself however just incase that isnt enough information here is a little more.</div>

		<p>My full name is <span STYLE="font-variant: small-caps">Evan Andrew Jones</span>, but most of my friends just refer to me as EJ. I was born in Atlanta, Georgia and have lived here my entire life. I went to highschool at WhiteWater, a pretty large school on the outskirts of Peachtree City. After highschool the obvious next step was to attend UGA as my parents before me did.</p>

		<p>I am currently studying finance through the Terry College of Business. After getting my degree I plan to pursue a masters in bussiness and a JD from the <span STYLE="font-style:oblique">Emory school of Law</span>. Ive always dreamed of having a law degree so I might one day be able to purse a job in government. The way government operates has always facinated me, it is truly remarkable how ineffiecint it is.Then again ive always been interested in computer science, but I always thought it would be too complicated. This class has shown me some basic fucntions and ablilites of computers that I never knew could be so simple that is as long as you know what you are doing. With such a good experience through this class I will likely try and pick up some more classes in this field and refine my computer skills.</p>

		<p>Here is a picture of me.</p>
